# Function-Point-Analysis-Calculator-Python-

The function point is a "unit of measurement" used to describe the level of business functionality offered to a user by an information system (as a product). Software's functional size measurement (FSM) is calculated using function points. The price of a single unit is computed from previous projects (in dollars or hours).

Thus Function Point is used in Software Metrics and is calculated as follows:
FP = Count-total * [0.65 + 0.01 *âˆ‘(fi)]
    = Count-total * CAF
